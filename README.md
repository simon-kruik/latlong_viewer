# latlong_viewer
This is an application created with multiple purposes:
- Gain experience using NodeJS, and Electron (for Desktop usage)
- Understand how to handle geographical data using a library like Leaflet
- Be able to visualize a [dataset](http://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/10/9/745/s1) containing latitude and longitude values for abandoned mines across Australia

To that end, it is primarily intended for the developer's use and for reference. 
If you'd like to run it, there may be Releases in the future, or if you have NodeJS installed on your machine you can:
```shell
npm install
npm start
```
